## 5. Zero Harm Override

All RegenNode forks must implement a **harm-checking mechanism** that verifies:

If harm is found or reported, a fork must:
- Pause DAO proposals until resolved  
- Publish a community resolution path  
- Optionally escalate to RegenNode Core or RegenGraph Council

## 6. Data Sovereignty

- All emotional, ecological, and ritual data remains **owned by the community where it was generated**  
- Data may not be sold, extracted, or used for profiling  
- Opt-in DreamSync entries must remain encrypted and non-indexable

You are encouraged to fork this project **only if**:

- You create a cultural layer of your own (myth, ritual, names)  
- You agree to publicly share at least one season of data  
- You accept that healing must outpace profit  
- You intend to join the global mesh, not extract from it
