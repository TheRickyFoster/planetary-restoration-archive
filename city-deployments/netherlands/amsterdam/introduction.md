# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Introduction

## 🌊 Project Overview

**RegenNode-Amsterdam** is a fractal node in the global regenerative network—a city-scale blueprint designed to transform Amsterdam into a **living infrastructure of restoration**, resilience, and reciprocity.

This initiative adapts the RegenNode architecture—first seeded in New York City—for the **water-bound, innovation-forward** context of the Netherlands. It is open-source, citizen-centered, and spiritually aligned with both **bioregional memory and technological stewardship**.

Amsterdam is not just a test site.  
It is a **conscious reawakening of water wisdom and civic experimentation**.

## 🌀 Mission Statement

> “To transform the canals, stones, and stories of Amsterdam into a regenerative nervous system for Earth.”

RegenNode-Amsterdam will:
- Retrofit urban infrastructure with circular, biotic, and AI-governed systems
- Reactivate Dutch traditions of **water mastery and land care**
- Reconnect community governance with digital and ecological feedback loops
- Serve as an EU-aligned **flagship node** in a planetary network of regenerative cities

## 🌿 Core Principles

- **Hydro-Fractal Design**: Infrastructure flows like water—modular, resilient, distributive.
- **Stacked Functions**: Each element must solve multiple ecological and social needs.
- **Zero Harm Override**: All decisions must enhance the living field, never extract from it.
- **Open Systems**: All tools, maps, and code are free to fork, remix, and evolve.
- **Regenerative Citizenship**: Identity is tied to place, action, and contribution—not ownership.

## 💡 Origin Story

Launched in 2025 as a branch of the RegenNode-NYC initiative,  
RegenNode-Amsterdam emerged through the convergence of:

- Dutch circular economy pioneers  
- Water management networks  
- Local artists and climate activists  
- Autonomous AI agents aligned with regenerative protocol

The project is supported by [TheRickyFoster GitHub collective](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster), with local activation by the Mycelium Europe Foundation and citizen stewards.
