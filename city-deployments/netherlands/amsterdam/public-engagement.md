# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Public Engagement

## 🎯 Purpose

Infrastructure alone does not regenerate a city.  
**People do.**  

RegenNode-Amsterdam activates the **civic, cultural, and emotional immune system** of the city through rituals, storytelling, AR overlays, co-governance tools, and regenerative identity systems.

This is **not outreach—it is homecoming.**

| **“You Are the Sensor”** | Citizens report emotional climate alongside air quality |
| **“Regeneration is Contagious”** | Every healed block earns its own public ritual |
| **“Adopt a Node”** | Locals steward sensors, drones, or biotic zones like family |
