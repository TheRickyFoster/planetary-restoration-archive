# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Deployment Plan

## 🧭 Overview

This phased plan outlines the full deployment of RegenNode-Amsterdam across time, neighborhoods, and system layers.  
It follows a **hydrological rhythm**—from rainfall to river, from intention to replication.

Each phase builds regenerative intelligence into the city’s **canals, courtyards, rooftops, and rituals**.

## 🌿 Phase Structure

| Phase | Name         | Duration      | Focus |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 0     | **Seeding**  | 0–3 months     | Mapping, partnerships, narrative ignition |
| 1     | **Rooting**  | 3–9 months     | First regen kits deployed; AI/DAO sync begins |
| 2     | **Canopy**   | 9–24 months    | Multi-borough deployment + feedback loops |
| 3     | **Pulse**    | 24–48 months   | Self-regulating regen mesh; XR culture layer active |
| 4     | **Flow**     | 4+ years       | Fork Amsterdam model globally (RegenNode-EU & beyond) |

## 🌱 Phase 0: Seeding

### Goals:
- Identify pilot borough(s): Nieuw-West, IJburg, or Oost preferred  
- Form Regen Steward Council (local artists, coders, permaculturists, youth reps)  
- Localize `RegenNode Companion` app + launch web node  
- Initiate public ritual calendar (Seasonal AR altars, canal-side storyboards)  
- Run baseline scans: air, water, soil, sentiment

### Outputs:
- `regen-map.geojson` of priority streets, blocks, nodes  
- `system_summary.md` tailored for Amsterdam fork  
- Initial $REGENAMS token model scoped (non-speculative)

---

## 🌾 Phase 1: Rooting

### Goals:
- Deploy RegenKit v1 to 1–3 streets per pilot zone  
  - MossMesh walls  
  - Air drones  
  - Compost DAO pilot  
  - Water biocurtains  
- Activate DAO proposals + vote for repair tasks  
- Host “Ritual of Soil Return” across 3+ neighborhoods  
- Begin live logging to RegenGraph network

### Outputs:
- `deployment_log.csv` initiated  
- AR-based block status overlays online  
- Sensor data streamed publicly (opt-in mode)

---

## 🌳 Phase 2: Canopy

### Goals:
- Scale from 3 zones → 3 boroughs  
- MycoBattery + solar-bike mesh + drone-swarm net in public trial  
- Integrate with libraries, museums, and schools  
- Launch cross-Dutch city DAO (connect Utrecht, Rotterdam forks)  
- Host “Canal of Light” ceremony — cultural awakening + metrics reveal

### Outputs:
- Shared DAO token governance now live  
- Monthly Citizen Pulse Report auto-generated  
- Ritual log indexed in `cultural_lore.md`

---

## 💓 Phase 3: Pulse

### Goals:
- Full self-adjusting regen mesh: air, water, ritual, story, repair  
- Autonomous repair loops: agents respond to damage, trigger DAO votes  
- XR/AR layer fully active city-wide  
- Emotional ecology integrated (DreamSync logs inform myth layer)

### Outputs:
- First successful **AI-generated ritual proposal** accepted  
- Tourist tax redirected into DAO fund pilot  
- Shared governance across >100,000 citizens

---

## 🌊 Phase 4: Flow

### Goals:
- Amsterdam RegenNode forks shared into:
  - RegenNode-Rotterdam
  - RegenNode-Utrecht
  - RegenNode-Kigali, Berlin, Accra  
- RegenNode-Amsterdam becomes part of “Living Infrastructure EU Taskforce”
- Summits of the Nodes hosted in Amsterdam, with seasonal mirror nodes across Europe

### Outputs:
- Amsterdam regen kit forked 100+ times globally  
- Documentary + open curriculum released  
- RegenGraph integrates across all participating EU cities

---

## 🛡️ Built-In Resilience

Every deployment phase includes:
- Offline operation mode (mesh-powered)
- Zero Harm test harness (blocks risky code or toxic interventions)
- Cultural Feedback Layer (ritual logs + community voice loop)
- Self-repair and decay-resistance audit every quarter

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric                     | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Moss wall installs         | 30+           | 120+          |
| Drone swarm nodes active   | 10            | 100           |
| DAO voter turnout          | 15%           | 45%+          |
| Ritual participation       | 500 citizens  | 5,000+        |
| Compost diverted (tonnes)  | 50            | 250           |
| Soil biodiversity recovery | +40%          | +70%          |
