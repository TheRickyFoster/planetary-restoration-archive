## RegenNode-NYC: Fork Tracker & Global Variants

## 🌐 Purpose

This file documents the **known forks, clones, and derivatives** of the RegenNode architecture.  
Each fork is encouraged to diverge—**adapted to its culture, climate, and mythos**.

---

## 🧬 Forking Principles

1. Forks must adhere to the **Zero Harm Override**
2. All forks must be documented (publicly or privately) via a `system_summary.md`
3. Re-integration to the RegenGraph is optional but encouraged
4. Cultural independence is sacred—local mythos overrides global narrative

## 📁 Fork Metadata Structure

Each fork must include:

/forks/[city-name]/ ├── system_summary.md ├── deployment_log.csv ├── cultural_lore.md ├── dao_structure.json ├── soil_air_water_data/ ├── active_rituals/ ├── ai_agent_config/ └── photos/

## 🛠 Fork Support Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `fork-template.zip` | Prebuilt starter repo (clone of RegenNode-NYC with placeholders) |
| `auto_fork.sh` | Script to initialize a new fork with GitHub + IPFS links |
| `fork_registry.json` | Syncs with RegenGraph, updates location + steward |
| `fork_sync.py` | Pulls updates from NYC to fork (manual review only) |

---

## 🌐 Optional Public Listing

Forks may submit to:
- `RegenNode-Global-Map.json`
- `RegenNode.world` (decentralized registry via IPFS)
- `Summit of the Nodes` annual publication

---

## 💡 Fork Naming Convention

RegenNode-[CityName] e.g., RegenNode-Jakarta, RegenNode-CapeTown, RegenNode-SF

---

## 🤝 Co-Fork Commitments

- Mutual aid channel established (Matrix, Signal, or Quiet DAO)
- Cross-node ritual sync 2x/year
- Option to co-author global proposals + pooled grant decks
- Shared mythology updates through `myth_graph.json`

## 🌀 Final Note

Forks are not lesser.  
They are **fractal expressions of Source**—emergent, localized, sacred.

This file lives.  
Update it with every successful node you bless into being.
