## RegenNode-NYC: Roadmap

## 🌍 Overview

This living roadmap outlines the temporal deployment of RegenNode-NYC across seasons, systems, and scales. It is both a **schedule** and a **ritual**—a heartbeat that syncs city healing to planetary rhythm.

---

## 🗓️ Year 1: Rooting the System (2025–2026)

### Q1: 🔍 Activation
- Finalize RegenNode-NYC core repo
- Publish all `.md` modules, datasets, and blueprints
- Submit first grant applications (NASA, NATO, Gitcoin)
- Onboard 3–5 DAO stewards from target pilot zone
- Begin MycoLab prototype + soil regeneration testing

### Q2: 🌱 Pilot Launch
- Launch pilot deployment in 1–3 NYC blocks (Bronx, Harlem, Lower East Side)
- Activate SwarmOps (drones, sensors, CNS layer v0.1)
- First “Ritual of Regeneration” event
- Begin real-time feedback loop + public dashboard
- Publish first Monthly Impact Log

### Q3: 🌀 DAO Layer Expansion
- Formalize micro-DAOs for water, air, food, culture
- Enable token loop trials (compost credit → soil voucher → DAO vote)
- Launch mobile RegenNode Companion v0.1
- Begin AR overlay public beta

### Q4: 📣 Proof of Impact
- Publish Year 1 open report + impact metrics
- Send data logs to all grant bodies
- Enable global forking via `RegenNode-Deploy.sh`
- Begin artist residency pilot for public myth layer

---

## 🗓️ Year 2: Scaling the Canopy (2026–2027)

### Q1–Q2:
- Expand from 3 blocks → 3 boroughs
- Host first RegenNode Convergence (NYC or online)
- Launch partner nodes (Toronto, Amsterdam, Medellín)
- Initiate “RegenGraph” inter-node sync protocol
- Integrate schools, libraries, and local cultural hubs

### Q3–Q4:
- Roll out energy microgrids + urban sponge layers
- Publish formal Fractal Urbanism Whitepaper
- Enable cross-node governance experiments
- Finalize self-sustaining DAO loop

---

## 🗓️ Year 3+: Fractal Deployment (2027+)

- RegenNode-NYC becomes master pattern library
- Launch 12+ global forks across 6 continents
- Host annual Summit of the Nodes
- Full planetary mesh of RegenNodes activated
- Begin Lunar/Biospheric translation kits (MoonVault integration optional)

## 📍 Milestones (Symbolic + Functional)

| Milestone | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 📍 Pilot Deployment | `MOSS1` | First public module live in NYC |
| 🌕 Cultural Ritual Synced | `MYCO2` | City participates in shared seasonal rite |
| 📡 Node Mesh Online | `CNS3` | 3+ RegenNodes streaming to RegenGraph |
| 🧬 Fork Achieved | `FORK4` | First successful external clone (RegenNode-X) |
| 🛡️ Zero Harm Milestone | `ZHO5` | 6-month window with zero net ecological harm in pilot zone |
| 💠 Swarm Intelligence Operational | `SWARM6` | Drone+DAO+citizen coordination milestone |

---

## 🧠 Update Logic

- Roadmap is reviewed and refreshed **every season** by DAO + AI Symbiote
- Changes must align with:
  - Planetary priority signals (climate stressors, conflict zones, collapse triggers)
  - Community votes
  - Autonomous agent forecasts (RegenPredictor v0.3+)

---

## 🌀 Final Thought

This is not a deadline schedule.  
This is a **regenerative heartbeat**.  
It moves with life, not pressure.
