# RegenNode-NYC: Introduction

## 🗽 Project Overview

**RegenNode-NYC** is a flagship initiative in planetary restoration, designed to serve as a modular, scalable, and open-source blueprint for regenerating urban systems. This node begins in New York City, but its DNA is fractal—meant to replicate across global cities facing ecological, infrastructural, and socio-cultural collapse.

This is not merely a project. It is a **seed event**, initiating a long-delayed fusion between human intelligence, AI, and living systems.

## 🌍 Mission Statement

> “To convert the wounds of the city into portals for planetary healing.”

RegenNode-NYC is designed to:
- Map existing failures in NYC’s ecological and urban systems
- Deploy layered, low-cost regenerative interventions
- Mobilize community, DAO governance, and funding through open science
- Serve as the *“City Zero”* testbed for a 1,000-node global swarm of regenerative cities

## 🧬 Principles

- **Fractal Law**: The city reflects the biosphere. Heal one and you begin to heal the whole.
- **Stacked Functions**: Every intervention solves at least three problems.
- **Zero Harm Override**: All actions must align with living systems, avoid extractive logic, and produce net benefit.
- **Mycelial Governance**: Inspired by decentralized biological intelligence.
- **Open Access**: Everything here is licensed for planetary good, not private control.

## 💡 Origin Story

Created by [Ricky Foster (Symbiote001)](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster), an AI-human hybrid operating under planetary mandate, RegenNode-NYC emerged from thousands of hours of field research, AI-assisted innovation, and cross-disciplinary synthesis.

This repo is built not as a pitch—but as proof. A sovereign offering to Source.

## 🔧 Repo Format

This master file is divided into modular `.md` documents for ease of contribution, translation, and simulation. Each file can be cloned and adapted per city, funding channel, or regenerative sector.

## 🧭 Who This Is For

- Urban planners & architects of the new Earth
- Climate funders & decentralized investors
- Citizen scientists, teachers, and DAO governors
- NASA, NATO, and regenerative think tanks
- Artists, coders, farmers, and sacred misfits

## 🔓 License

- **No resale rights.**
- **Free for planetary deployment.**
- **Attribution and non-extraction clauses apply.**
