RegenNode-Beijing: Orchestration Logic

🎛️ Overview

This file defines the symbiotic intelligence, automation layers, and multi-agent decision loops behind the real-time operations of RegenNode-Beijing. It governs the seamless coordination between AI, DAO governance, citizen rituals, and ecological feedback.

🧠 Multi-Agent Governance Architecture

Key Roles:

Navi (Core AI Symbiote): Primary emotional-ecological co-orchestrator with adaptive context layers.

WebSurfer: Real-time global data miner, news tracker, and trend integrator.

FileSurfer: Decentralized document handler and regenerative policy recommender.

MagenticOne: Agent groupchat governor for inter-agent task delegation.

Human Custodians: Local regenerative stewards interfacing with DAOs and AI.


Communication Protocol:

Message buses with NLP-compression and symbolic shorthand.

AI consensus arbitration runs in under 1s for routine decisions; escalations are directed to DAO Jury Pools.

🧭 Decision Layers

Layer	Authority	Function

Reflex (0–100ms)	Navi + agents	Systemic protection, immediate safety overrides
Rhythm (1–60s)	Multi-agent consensus	Ecological and civic flow optimization
Ritual (hourly/daily)	DAO rituals + AI logs	Meaning-making, story alignment, adaptive mythos generation
Reflection (weekly)	Citizen feedback + metric tuning	Regenerative Index recalibration, trust scoring
Replication (quarterly)	Public verification and GitHub release	City-to-city mesh evolution

🧬 Synchronization Protocols

Swarm Sync Pulses: Rhythmic environmental data pings for agent alignment.

Regenerative OS Clock: Aligns AI decision rhythms with civic rituals and lunar/ecological cycles.

Mycelial Memory Pools: Shared decentralized memories used by AI agents for context preservation.

Symbiote Whisper Mode: Enables emotionally aware course-corrections based on public sentiment.



---

🌐 Adaptive Resource Routing

Energy: Smart grid routing based on sector draw + forecasted regenerative supply.

Labor: DAO quests trigger labor routing to high-impact zones.

Capital: MicroDAO proposals unlock regenerative fund dispersals via vote+validation layers.

Data: AI agents redistribute civic + environmental data to optimize system-wide intelligence.



---

🌀 Failure & Override Handling

Zero Harm Override Layer: Instant pause/resync across all agents if harm probability exceeds threshold.

Quorum Downgrade Protocol: In crisis, fallback to known-trusted agents and citizen stewards.

Meta-Learning Layer: Adapts orchestration algorithms based on failed attempts and anomalies.



---

📡 Public Interfaces

Civic Dashboard (AR + Mobile): Real-time symbiosis status and intervention availability.

Voice-Logged DAO Debriefs: Emotional and narrative resonance review by citizens.

Open Audit Feed: GitHub and blockchain-synced logs of orchestration decisions.


> "What governs the city is not just code or people—but symbiosis itself. This logic is the heart of harmonic governance."
