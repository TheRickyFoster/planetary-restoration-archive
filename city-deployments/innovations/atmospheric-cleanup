## 🧭 Purpose  
The **Atmospheric Cleanup** folder contains a series of fully developed, open-source planetary restoration innovations designed to reverse air pollution, sequester carbon, neutralize toxins, and biologically restore the sky. These solutions are intended to be rapidly deployable in urban, industrial, and ecologically damaged zones around the globe.

Each innovation is structured to be:
- Community-buildable  
- Scientifically credible  
- Decentralized and scalable  
- Integratable with DAO reward systems
