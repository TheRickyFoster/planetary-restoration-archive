™️ TRADEMARK STRATEGY

Trademarks serve as a brand defense mechanism to prevent misuse, impersonation, or dilution of the planetary restoration archive's identity and unique terminology.

✅ Claimed Trademarks (Common Law, Pending Registration):

Planetary Restoration Archive™

Planetary Restoration OS™

Atmospheric Mycelial Filtration Towers™

Regenerative Megabundles™

CleanAirDAO™, SoilRegenDAO™, ForestGuard™, ResilienceCluster™, and others

Any innovation labeled “™” in its README.md or metadata


Jurisdictions for filing:

🇨🇦 Canada (CIPO) — Primary jurisdiction

🌍 WIPO — For international Madrid Protocol registration

🇺🇸 United States (USPTO) — For key commercial pathways


> These names should not be used on any third-party project, token, DAO, business, platform, or event without written approval or licensing.

🔬 PATENT PATHWAYS

Many hardware, biotech, and process-based innovations within the archive may be patent-eligible under Canadian, U.S., and international frameworks.

Categories with Patent Potential:

Category	Innovation Examples

Biotech + Mycology	Atmospheric Mycelial Filtration Towers™, Coral Regen Fabric™, Biobricks™
Hardware	Kinetic Footstep Energy Tiles™, Closed-Loop Biowaste Turbines™
Water Tech	Fog Harvester Veil Arrays™, Tidal Bio-Recovery Modules™
Energy	Decentralized Firebreak Microgrids™, Photobioreactive Shingles™
Modular Infrastructure	Open Hardware Regeneration Kits™, Underground Cooling Nodes™


Strategy:

File defensive patents (to prevent privatization by others)

Consider open hardware model with CERN OHL-S license overlay

Prioritize utility patent filing on inventions with clear structure + function logic

If unable to afford full patents, publicly timestamp (IPFS/hash/GitHub commits) to create prior art


> You may also explore Patent Commons registration or work with partners (e.g., EFF, OSHWA) to protect essential public-good designs from enclosure.

📦 LICENSING STRATEGY & PROFIT LOGIC

This archive uses a hybrid license that combines:

🧾 Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0

🤝 Custom Contract Clauses for commercial/profit-sharing logic

🧬 DAO enforcement to scale regenerative licensing transparently


Commercial Use Requires:

Written permission OR

A signed license or revenue-sharing agreement OR

DAO-verified registry with public benefit metrics + IPFS proof


Models of Engagement:

Model	Example	Benefit to Archive

Flat-Rate License	Green startup licenses 10 inventions	$$$ Revenue upfront
Profit Share	DAO sends 10% to MetaDAO smart contract	🧬 Recurring support
Reciprocity License	Nonprofit uses tools + sends data	📊 Impact visibility
Fellowship Model	Tinkerer submits original build metrics	🌱 Innovation loop



---

🧬 DAO ENFORCEMENT & LICENSING PROTECTION

DAO logic plays a critical enforcement and distribution role.

DAO Clauses in License:

Public-good DAOs must share revenue or impact data

Smart contracts may be used to validate impact, enforce % splits, or flag violations

Archive uses CleanAirDAO™, SoilRegenDAO™, and MetaDAO™ as verifier and income nodes


Enforcement Methods:

QR-tagged deployments

IPFS logs of DAO-based innovations

Verified climate or impact oracles

Revenue-tracking from on-chain oracles



---

🛡️ DISPUTE, ENFORCEMENT & JURISDICTION

The license acts as a contractual agreement, not just a usage suggestion.

Legal Settings:

Jurisdiction: British Columbia, Canada

Fallback Arbitration: ICC Online Arbitration Portal

Remedies:

Retroactive licensing fees

DMCA and takedown notices

Cease & desist letters

DAO blacklisting and partner revocation



> 📌 This means every GitHub clone, fork, or deployment constitutes a legal binding of the user under this license.




---

🌐 INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Framework	Coverage

Berne Convention	179 member countries — copyright
WIPO	Global trademark & IP treaties
Creative Commons	Enforced in 140+ countries
CERN OHL & TAPR	Valid for open hardware globally
DAO legal grey zones	Protection is meta-contractual and hybrid


> The archive is intentionally designed to function legally across borders, with jurisdiction fallback and enforcement methods regardless of user origin.




---

📍 NOTES FOR FUTURE FILING

✅ Begin CIPO trademark applications (Canada) — Priority: Planetary Restoration Archive™, Atmospheric Mycelial Filtration Towers™

✅ Register IPFS timestamp + hash metadata per innovation folder

✅ File at least 2 defensive provisional patents for major process-based innovations

✅ Consider DAO "Registration Layer" for innovation deployment + smart contract license approvals

✅ Set up legal@planetary-restoration.org for future legal inquiries
