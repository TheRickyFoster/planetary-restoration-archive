# 🧬 Fractal Fertilization Hypothesis

The **Fractal Fertilization Hypothesis** proposes that the biological principle of **egg-driven sperm selection** may reflect a fractal symmetry at planetary scales:

> **Sperm : Egg :: Human : Earth**

In this view, **Earth itself may act as an active selector**, not passively receiving human interventions but filtering, guiding, and accepting only those compatible with its systemic health.

## 🧠 Summary

- **Eggs deploy chemoattractants** that enable cryptic female choice.  
- **Not all sperm are equally favored**; molecular compatibility matters.  
- By analogy, **Earth may “select” ideas, technologies, and civilizational patterns that harmonize with biospheric integrity**.
