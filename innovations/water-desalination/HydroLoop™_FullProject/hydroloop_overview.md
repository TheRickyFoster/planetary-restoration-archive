## 🌐 What is HydroLoop™?

HydroLoop™ is a **closed-loop modular desalination system** designed for rapid deployment in water-scarce, grid-unstable, and decentralized environments.

Rather than relying on single-use RO membranes or high-energy systems, HydroLoop™ uses a **solar/thermal regenerative distillation core**, reclaiming condensate and greywater into a continuous, filtered cycle. The system is tuned for **community-scale**, not megascale infrastructure.

## ⚙️ Core System Architecture

### 🔁 Functional Layers

| Layer            | Role                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Intake** | Brackish, seawater, or runoff enters via a low-pressure intake |
| **Heating Core** | Passive or active heating via solar or thermal units     |
| **Vapor Pathway**| Vapor moves through coiled copper/aluminum condenser     |
| **Condensate Loop** | Collected vapor condenses into potable output and recycles heat |
| **Greywater Return** | Wastewater re-treated, filtered, and recirculated      |

HydroLoop can be containerized, rooftop-mounted, or field-deployed via flat-pack kits.
