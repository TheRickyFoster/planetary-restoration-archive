# ☀️ Solar-Thermal Variant – HydroLoop™

## Overview
This design uses concentrated solar heat to drive evaporation and condensation without requiring electricity. Ideal for arid or equatorial zones with high sun exposure.

---

## Components

- Flat plate solar collector (black-painted aluminum or copper, ~0.6m²)  
- Insulated evaporation chamber with transparent lid (acrylic or glass)  
- Passive airflow via chimney or vent  
- Reflective surface (mirror/foil) to boost input (optional)  
- Condensate coil + distillate collection tray  
- Thermal buffer: recycled stone/bricks for heat retention

---

## Construction Notes

- Angle collector at 30–45° for latitude tuning  
- Insulate chamber base with foam, wool, or earth  
- Use food-safe sealant around all condensation paths  
- Vapor should rise, hit coil, and drip directly into sterile basin  
- Add optional glass wool barrier to prevent splashback
