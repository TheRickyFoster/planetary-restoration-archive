# 🧠 HydroLoop™ – DAO Integration & Telemetry Logic  
**File:** dao_integration.md  
**Linked To:** [README.md](./README.md) | [HydroLoop_Overview.md](./HydroLoop_Overview.md) | [TermuxInstaller.sh](./TermuxInstaller.sh) (WIP)

## 🌐 Overview

HydroLoop™ is designed to plug directly into decentralized governance systems. This file defines how to integrate HydroLoop units into a **DAO-based telemetry**, **incentivization**, and **impact-tracking framework**. This allows local communities, donors, and global DAOs to track water output, fund deployments, and verify field performance — all without centralized infrastructure.

## 🧾 Key DAO Functions

| Function Name       | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `recordUptime()`    | Logs hourly/daily operational status         |
| `recordOutput()`    | Stores liters/day output from sensors or manual entry |
| `triggerPayout()`   | Sends DAO token or reward when criteria met  |
| `logMaintenance()`  | Logs maintenance events + duration           |
| `mintProof()`       | Stores hash of local performance logs on IPFS or Arweave |

🛠️ Integration Steps

🧩 Option 1: Sensor-Based DAO Link

1. Install basic flowmeter (analog or digital)


2. Connect output to Termux script or ESP32 device


3. Push logs to local JSON


4. Hash + pin logs to IPFS using ipfs-push.sh


5. Submit IPFS CID to DAO smart contract → triggers recordOutput()



📝 Option 2: Manual DAO Participation

1. Local steward fills out .json log file daily


2. Uploads to IPFS using Termux or desktop


3. DAO listens for CIDs + verifies formatting


4. Rewards sent manually or via multisig/gnosis-safe

🪙 Reward Model (Example)

Threshold	Reward

>95% uptime / 30d	50 H2O tokens or credits
>1000L / month	1 community reward badge
Verified data	DAO log hash NFT minted


> Note: tokens must be non-extractive, local-loop compatible, and opt-in.

🔒 Security & Ethics

DAO should never track identity or private location

Logs should be hashed, not raw

Participation in DAO tracking is opt-in only

Oracles should include field agents, not just remote tech



---

📂 Future Hooks

DAO multisig trigger for bulk deployments

Mobile alert system for performance dips

Real-time dashboard w/ Mapbox, IPFS pinlist, DAO voting
