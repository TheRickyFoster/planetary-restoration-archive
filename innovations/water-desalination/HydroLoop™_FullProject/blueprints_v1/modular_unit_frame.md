## 🧱 Frame Overview

- Rectangular housing (~80cm x 60cm x 60cm)  
- Designed for **2–5 unit vertical stack**  
- Openable front plate for filter & loop access  
- Top-mount solar/thermal collector  
- Integrated drip tray and output nozzle

## 📐 Cut Sheet (CNC / Manual)

| Panel              | Material      | Cut Size (cm) | Notes                         |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Base panel         | HDPE / Plywood| 80 x 60        | Drain hole in center          |
| Side panels (x2)   | Same          | 60 x 60        | Inlet hole + maintenance port |
| Back panel         | Same          | 80 x 60        | Optional mount for control box|
| Front hatch        | Acrylic/Metal | 80 x 60        | Hinged w/ clasp               |
| Top collector plate| Aluminum      | 80 x 60        | Supports solar input          |

## 🔩 Connection Points

- Corner L-brackets + screws (or 3D-printed fastenings)  
- Drainage slope built into base (2° incline)  
- Greywater return at 5cm above base  
- Coils mount on inner sidewalls using clip rings

## 🛠 Assembly Notes

- All panels should use **non-toxic sealant** along joints  
- Use soft grommets on all pipe exits  
- Optional: Insert insulation layer between outer and inner housing walls (foam, wool, or recycled textile)

## 🧪 Testing Notes

Test before stacking:
- Tilt test: ensure no condensate backflow  
- Tap test: check frame resonance for leak spots  
- Fill test: run 10L cycle and monitor for leakage
