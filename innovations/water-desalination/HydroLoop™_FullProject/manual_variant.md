# üõ†Ô∏è Manual / Zero-Electricity Variant ‚Äì HydroLoop‚Ñ¢

## Overview  
This fully non-electric HydroLoop‚Ñ¢ variant is engineered for **total energy independence** ‚Äî no solar panels, batteries, or electronics required. Suitable for disaster zones, rural villages, and post-collapse deployment.

## Core Principles

- All heat is generated via fire, sunlight, compost, or thermal mass  
- Water movement via gravity, capillary action, or manual pumping  
- No sensors, no circuits ‚Äî 100% analog and repairable with basic tools

---

## Components

- Metal evaporation basin (e.g. recycled pot or kettle)  
- Charcoal-based heat source or solar reflector  
- Condensate capture lid (glass/metal) with downward slope  
- Food-grade tubing to collection container  
- Clay/ceramic pre-filter and gravel layers  
- Greywater inlet and catch basin  
- Optional: Bell siphon or jug for manual recirculation

---

## Operating Steps

1. Fill evaporation basin with brackish or greywater  
2. Apply heat via fire, compost heat, or sunlight  
3. Steam condenses on lid and runs to collector  
4. Greywater recirculates via gravity loop or by hand  
5. Periodically clean filter layers (gravel, charcoal, sand)

## Yield Expectations

| Heat Source       | Output/day (est.) | Notes                        |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Fire (wood/biomass)| 10‚Äì20 L/day       | Supervise for safety         |
| Compost            | 2‚Äì5 L/day         | Needs insulation + patience  |
| Solar              | 5‚Äì10 L/day        | Adjust with season & angle   |

## Resilience Design

- Can be replicated in low-resource environments  
- No rare components or electronics  
- All diagrams printable and paper-archivable  
- Ideal for pairing with educational workshops or permaculture sites
