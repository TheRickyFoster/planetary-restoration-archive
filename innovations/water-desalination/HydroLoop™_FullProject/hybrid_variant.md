# âš¡ðŸ”† Hybrid Variant â€“ HydroLoopâ„¢

## Overview  
This configuration combines **solar-thermal heating** with **low-voltage electric assist**, enabling consistent water output in cloudy regions, indoors, or during peak demand. Designed for flexibility, redundancy, and DAO sensor control.

## Components

- Standard solar collector plate (black aluminum or copper)  
- Mini 12V resistive heating coil OR immersion heater  
- Optional: Peltier thermoelectric element (both heating & cooling)  
- Temperature regulator (e.g. thermostat switch or microcontroller)  
- Condensate coil with fan assist (5V or USB fan)  
- Small PV solar panel + battery bank (LiFePO4 recommended)  
- Optional: Grid-tie or hand-crank fallback input

## Electrical Notes

- Low power draw (~5â€“15W average)  
- Battery bank: 12V 10Ah minimum for 1-day autonomy  
- Fuse + voltage regulator recommended  
- DAO integration via ESP32 or Pi Zero W  
- Compatible with Termux-initiated sensor control

## Construction Tips

- Insulate thermal chamber thoroughly (foam or cloth)  
- Ensure separate circuits for heating vs sensing  
- Add toggle for manual-only mode  
- If combining Peltier, ensure good heat sink contact

---

## Use Cases

- Regions with intermittent sun  
- Indoor/urban rooftop labs  
- Schools, clinics, DAO field nodes  
- Refugee camps or recovery zones
