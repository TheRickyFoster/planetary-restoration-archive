🔍 What This Shows:

This is a scatter plot of all 1,000 drone swarm simulations comparing:

🟩 Total pollutants removed per day (kg)

💸 Cost per ton of pollutant removed


The red dashed line represents the $150/ton efficiency threshold. All points below the line are cost-effective, with many scenarios under $100/ton — a remarkable result for atmospheric tech.

🧠 Takeaways:

The DAO swarm has multiple sweet spots where it outperforms traditional air cleanup tech

Hybrid filter types and swarm sizes of 10,000+ dominate the low-cost, high-impact quadrant

Many simulations rival or beat industrial carbon scrubbing, which typically costs $400–$600/ton
