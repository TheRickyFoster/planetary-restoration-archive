🔍 What This Shows:

This graph demonstrates how increasing the size of the drone swarm dramatically improves cost efficiency:

🟣 Smaller swarms (100–1,000 drones) have higher per-ton filtration costs

🟢 Swarms of 10,000+ drones begin to drop below the $150/ton target

🟦 The trend shows clear economies of scale — each additional drone contributes to amplified efficiency thanks to shared logic, lower per-unit admin, and swarm intelligence.

🧠 Takeaways:

DAO logic must scale autonomously for max ROI

Funding DAO swarms at 10,000+ drones is both economical and impactful

This validates planetary-scale filtration architecture
