🔍 What This Shows:

This report compares the average cost efficiency and pollutant removal by filter type across all simulations.

📌 Key Insights:

Mycelium is extremely low-cost but modest in output — ideal for low-budget swarm startups

Hybrid (Carbon+Gel) consistently provides highest filtration volumes at near-optimal cost

Zeolite and Nano-Cellulose are more variable — effective in specific regional deployments


This data is critical for:

🧪 Filter material R&D

📦 DAO upgrade proposals

🌍 Regional filter customization
