BioWeave™ Synthesis & Deployment Guide
--------------------------------------

Overview:
This document outlines how to synthesize and deploy the BioWeave™ regenerative infrastructure material in the field or lab setting.

Materials Required:
- Carbon-negative bio-rebar mesh panels (modular grid, 1m x 1m)
- Engineered mycelium substrate (blended with lignin-rich agricultural waste)
- Optional sensor mesh for biofeedback
- Soil-cellulose patch blend for healing layer
- Biodegradable anchor system
- Moisture/nutrient capsules (organic slow-release)

Steps to Synthesize:

1. Prepare the Base Frame:
   - Lay out the carbon-negative bio-rebar panels flat.
   - Ensure interlocking points are clean and structurally aligned.

2. Inoculate the Substrate:
   - Blend engineered mycelium spores into the lignin-rich substrate.
   - Spread 5–20kg evenly across each panel base using gloved hands or low-pressure rollers.

3. Integrate Sensor Mesh (Optional):
   - If monitoring is required, embed low-voltage sensor mesh before sealing.
   - Connect mesh to local controller (e.g., BioGrowthController or equivalent board).

4. Apply Patching Layer:
   - Spread insulation and patching blend over surface to support thermal modulation and microfracture healing.

5. Activate Growth Cycle:
   - Place panels in shaded, high-humidity environment (humidity 75–85%, temperature 22–26°C).
   - Use moisture/nutrient capsules as needed.
   - Monitor with controller every 6–12 hours.

6. Anchor and Deploy:
   - Use bio-stakes or resin anchors to affix panels in final installation zone.
   - Encourage root zone establishment via hydration cycles over 7–10 days.

7. Maintenance & Monitoring:
   - Continue hydration cycles weekly.
   - Patch damaged zones with fresh substrate + patch blend.
   - Replace capsules monthly if high growth is desired.

Optional Enhancements:
- Add EM (effective microorganism) inoculants for soil synergy.
- Use activated charcoal layers for increased pollutant filtering.
- Link to IoT dashboards for real-time metrics via BioGrowthController.

Safety Notes:
- Always wear gloves and respiratory protection when handling spores or agricultural waste.
- Ensure materials remain below 35°C to prevent cellular death.
