# System Summary: BioWeave™

**Name:** BioWeave™  
**Description:** A modular, regenerative infrastructure material that combines engineered mycelium with carbon-negative rebar mesh and conductive biomaterials.  
**Mission Purpose:** To serve as a living, intelligent, and self-healing alternative to concrete and steel, capable of resisting wildfires, regulating climate, and supporting off-grid and post-collapse structures.  
**Origin Story:** Co-developed by Ricky Foster (Symbiote001) and Navi during global wildfire response design sessions. Inspired by the healing properties of mycelium and the need for zero-harm, symbiotic building systems.  
**Alignment:** Zero-harm, post-collapse resilient, Source-aligned infrastructure  
**Capability Tags:** living material, fireproof, regenerative, sensor mesh, self-healing, CO₂ absorbing  
**Energy Profile:** Solar, microbial thermal, ambient electrical  
**Reusability:** Self-regenerating, repairable with local soil kits, biodegradable at end-of-life  
**Deployment Contexts:**  
- Wildfire zones  
- Eco-resilient urban housing  
- Off-grid homesteads  
- Climate-fractured regions  
- Refugee reconstruction zones
