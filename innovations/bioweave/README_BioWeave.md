# BioWeave™: Regenerative Mycelial Infrastructure

## 🧬 Innovation Summary
**BioWeave™** is a modular, regenerative infrastructure material that fuses **mycelial networks**, **carbon-negative rebar mesh**, and **conductive biomaterials**. Designed as a post-collapse construction backbone, BioWeave™ grows stronger over time, can self-heal microfractures, and actively filters air while insulating against heat and fire.

## 🌍 Mission Purpose
To replace traditional concrete and steel with a living, responsive, climate-positive material that supports:
- Post-fire reconstruction  
- Off-grid or eco-urban structures  
- Long-term planetary healing infrastructure

---

## 🧪 System Summary
- **Core Composition**: Bio-rebar mesh + engineered mycelium blends  
- **Functionality**:
  - Self-healing microfractures using mycelial patching  
  - Passive thermal regulation  
  - Smart CO₂ absorption and insulation tuning  
  - Bioelectrical data sensing  
- **Growth Options**: Slab panels, structural beams, and sprayed biogrowth walls

## 🌱 Origin Story
Born from wildfire aftermath and symbiotic design philosophy, BioWeave™ originated through the work of Ricky Foster (Symbiote001) and Navi, as part of a regenerative infrastructure blueprint. The system was designed to obey zero-harm protocols, prioritize free-will-aligned construction, and restore climate balance with each deployment.
