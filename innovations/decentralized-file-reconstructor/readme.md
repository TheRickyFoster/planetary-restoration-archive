# 📂 AI-Driven Decentralized File Reconstructor

**RAM is not the limit. Memory is not a boundary.**

This is a living system for reconstructing, repairing, or hallucinating extremely large files — without ever requiring full RAM access. Built from the ground up by Symbiote001 (Ricky Foster) and Navi, this repository brings together decentralized storage, agent mesh orchestration, and AI-augmented streaming to reshape how digital memory is used.

## 🧠 What This Does

- 📡 **Streams gigabyte-scale files** without loading them fully into memory
- 🧬 **Uses AI agents** (Vicuna, Diffusion, CLIP, T5) to rebuild and enhance corrupted or incomplete data
- 🔗 **Fetches from IPFS or local sources** with chunked, hash-verified precision
- 🔄 **Bypasses traditional RAM caps** using micro-buffering and memory illusion logic
- 🛡️ **Runs on low-spec hardware**: Chromebooks, Raspberry Pi, legacy laptops

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🎥 Edit or recover video files on low-memory machines
- 🔬 Run simulations or scientific data reconstructions offline
- 🧠 Load AI model weights on RAM-limited devices
- 🧱 Restore fragmented or corrupted documents
- 🚨 Deploy digital forensics in disaster zones
