🛡️ Innovation #003 – Closed-Loop Catalytic Respirator™

> A bio-reactive lattice facemask that purifies both intake and exhale using layered catalysis and regenerative airflow design. ™




---

🧬 OVERVIEW

Closed-Loop Catalytic Respirator™ is a revolutionary facemask featuring:

Dual-flow lattice channels that independently handle inhalation purification and exhalation reprocessing.

Catalytic mesh (nano-silver, activated mycelium, or TiO₂-based) that reacts with exhaled moisture and CO₂ to trigger additional breakdown of VOCs and fine particulates in the environment.

Modular, replaceable bio-filters and electrostatic meshes that work synergistically with natural airflow and minor pressure differences to enhance longevity and efficiency.

Optional piezo-electric charge layers to self-charge and activate filtration zones with every breath or motion.

🔬 TECHNICAL FEATURES

Feature	Description

🌬️ Dual-Lattice Filtration	Split-channel internal lattice allows simultaneous intake purification and exhaust catalytic flow.
♻️ Regenerative Exhale Capture	Uses heat and moisture from the breath to activate catalytic layers that break down lingering particles or VOCs.
🧫 Myco-Zone Integration	Optional layer using dried Pleurotus ostreatus mycelium (activated by humidity) to trap and break down airborne toxins.
⚡ Piezo Layer Option	Converts breath and movement into light electric charge to power optional UV-A or electrostatic layers.
🛠️ Replaceable Core Modules	Modular filter cores can be snapped in/out for different environments (urban smog, wildfire, indoor mold, etc.).
