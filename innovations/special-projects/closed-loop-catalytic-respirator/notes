Here's a fully optimized prompt-style design brief for use in Onshape (or to share with any CAD-savvy collaborator). Since Onshape isn’t prompt-based, this is meant to guide the actual modeling steps inside the app.

🔧 📐 Onshape Modeling Prompt

Project Name: Closed-Loop Catalytic Respirator™

🧠 Objective:

Design a compact, ergonomic respirator with dual airflow channels — one for purified air intake and another for catalyzed exhalation. The goal is to create a re-circulating filtration system that processes both inhaled and exhaled air.


---

✅ Core Design Specifications:

1. Outer Shell (Face Mask Body)

Ergonomically shaped to cover nose and mouth

Use spline or loft to create contoured surface

Wall thickness: 2–3 mm

Include chin and nose curve for secure seal


2. Air Inlet Path

Side-mounted air intake chambers

Slot size for filters: 30mm x 30mm x 5mm

Layers:

Activated carbon

Catalytic mesh (metal)

Mycelium-infused medium (straw substrate)



3. Exhale Path

One-way silicon flap valve

Exhale port diameter: 19mm

Channel leads to catalytic ceramic bed or micro-reactor chamber

Option for body-heat-driven airflow or solar Peltier heating add-on


4. Filter Cartridge Bays

Snap-in filter cartridges (x2–3)

Gasket rim on edges for air-tight sealing


5. Strap Attachment Points

2–4 anchor holes for elastic/Velcro straps

Diameter: 5mm

Position around mask periphery


6. Optional Features

QR code patch mount (flat area 25x25mm)

LED or sensor housing near intake (optional, placeholder)

💾 File Exports (once modeled):

.STL for respirator shell

.STL for modular filter cartridge

.DXF of any 2D outlines for laser cutting (e.g. filter grid)



---

🛠️ Workflow Hints in Onshape:

Use Part Studio to build the shell in one parametric body

Create Assembly with valve, filters, and straps as separate parts

Use sketches to define filter cavities and breathing chamber

Use Shell, Loft, Extrude Cut, and Mate constraints as needed

Would you like me to:

Create a starter Onshape sketch set (.dxf or .partstudio)?

Run the same structure through Leonardo or Meshy for component-by-component visual outputs?


Once the first image finishes rendering, we can overlay Onshape instructions onto it for ultra-fast modeling.
