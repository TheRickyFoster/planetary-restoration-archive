## üß† What It Is  
The **Atmospheric Mycelial Filtration Tower‚Ñ¢** is a vertical living structure that uses breathable materials and living fungal mycelium to filter urban air, remove toxins, and regenerate airborne ecosystems. The towers harness nature‚Äôs own decomposition networks and place them in a breathable column that draws in dirty air and breathes out revitalized air.

This system is designed for **urban rooftops, deserts, polluted zones**, and even **post-wildfire landscapes**. It is modular, scalable, and biologically self-maintaining.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

- Base intake chambers draw polluted air into a tower filled with **activated carbon**, **biochar**, and **mycelial growth beds**.
- Fungal mycelium digests airborne pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NOx, CO, VOCs).
- Internal hydration system keeps the biological components alive.
- Clean air rises through a vertical chimney and exits via passive or solar-powered fans.
- Beneath the tower, **soil fungal networks** are optionally re-established.

**Fungi Used:**  
- *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom): known pollutant degrader  
- *Ganoderma lucidum* (reishi): long-lasting structural mycelium  
- Endophytic local strains adapted to specific pollution sources

## üèóÔ∏è How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

### üî® Construction Steps:
1. Assemble a lightweight frame (hexagonal, tubular, or triangular tower).
2. Wrap with breathable canvas or mesh (e.g., burlap or recycled plastic fabric).
3. Fill inner core with a layered matrix of:
   - Activated charcoal
   - Biochar
   - Fungal inoculated substrates (straw, hemp, jute)
4. Integrate internal tubing for mist or fog hydration.
5. Install solar chimney or passive convection chimney at top.
6. Anchor to rooftop, soil, or urban wall.

> Average construction time: 6‚Äì12 hours with 2‚Äì3 people  
> Lifespan: 3‚Äì5 years with seasonal inoculation

## üî¨ Scientific Basis & Studies  

- **Mycoremediation** is the use of fungi to remove pollutants.
  - Stamets, P. (2005). *Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World*.
- *Pleurotus ostreatus* has been proven to degrade hydrocarbons, CO, and formaldehyde.
- Fungi emit beneficial spores that colonize damaged ecosystems.
- Towers emulate **passive evaporative cooling towers** and **natural filter beds**.
