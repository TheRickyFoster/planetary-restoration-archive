🧠 What It Is

The Planetary Ecosystem Simulation Grid™ is a real-time, decentralized digital twin of Earth’s biosphere, built to predict, map, and coordinate ecological repair in every biome.

It merges AI, satellite data, and agent-based simulation to create a constantly updating, high-fidelity view of ecosystems, species flows, and resource thresholds — designed to drive regenerative actions across DAOs, governments, and grassroots teams.


---

⚙️ How It Works

1. Sensor Ingestion: Pulls real-time data from satellites, drones, ground stations, and public APIs (e.g. Copernicus, NOAA, Argo).


2. Biome Modeling: Simulates species flows, nutrient cycles, erosion, collapse thresholds.


3. Feedback Overlay: Projects where interventions are needed in real time.


4. Action Trigger Layer: Sends smart contract alerts to coordinate DAO repair missions.


5. Community Interface: Open dashboard for citizens to monitor and join tasks.




---

🏗️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

1. Deploy base server or decentralized mesh node with simulation engine (e.g., NetLogo, EarthSim, or Bespoke).


2. Configure live data ingestion layers (e.g. LoRaWAN, Earth API, Copernicus feed).


3. Train local biome agents using regional data and species libraries.


4. Set up DAO triggers based on collapse thresholds.


5. Expose public interface: map + alerts + bounty dashboards.



> Requires 1–3 devs + ecologists + open-source stack.
