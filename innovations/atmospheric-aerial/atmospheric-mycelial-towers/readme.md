## 🧠 Core Overview

### 📖 Introduction

The **Atmospheric Mycelial Filtration Tower™ (AMFT)** is a decentralized, biomaterial-based air purification structure designed for cities facing high particulate matter (PM) and CO₂ levels. Inspired by fungal morphology, it passively draws in polluted air and filters it through living mycelial mesh. Biodegradable, stackable, and community-owned, these towers are ready for DAO governance and mesh-network scaling.

### 📘 Mission & Vision

To restore breathable air through **living infrastructure** and create a pathway to global deployment of non-electric, autonomous, and regenerative purification towers—governed by **citizens and nature**, not corporations or fossil infrastructure.

### 📚 Curation Philosophy

This innovation blends:
- **Permaculture** (closed-loop living systems)
- **Biodesign** (fungal filtration materials)
- **DAO Governance** (community scaling)
- **Open Source** (every layer is forkable, printable, and libre)

🗺️ City Blueprint Example

In the New York City blueprint, AMFTs are proposed for:

Subway ventilation shafts

Public plazas

Rooftop edge installations


📊 Initial pilot: 20 towers
🏥 Projected impact: 13% drop in PM2.5 around NYU Medical Center within 3 months

🧪 Simulations

Expert panel simulation shows:

> 91% PM2.5 removal at moderate urban wind velocity



Mycelial pores (0.5–1mm) ideal for passive capture

Recommended: deployment in clusters of 3–5 towers per block

🏁 Final Reflections

🌍 What Comes Next

With just 100 towers per city, a global airborne particle drawdown of 5–9% is achievable by 2030. With community-powered DAO scaling, AMFTs are not just a climate tool — they are a symbol of regenerative civilization.

🪶 Message to Humanity

> “We breathe what we build. May these towers remind us that healing begins with the air between us.”



🕊️ Legacy & Continuity

Each tower includes a public plaque with blockchain timestamp, connecting its maintenance to DAO voting and local history. Towers will live on as cultural climate artifacts.

💀 Contingency Mode

In the event of collapse, the towers:

Can be broken down into compost

Require no power or servers

May operate indefinitely as passive bio-filters
