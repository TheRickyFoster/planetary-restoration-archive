# AeroHydra™: Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting

## 🌫️ Innovation Summary
**AeroHydra™** is a dynamic, AI-regulated water harvesting system that condenses moisture directly from air using a lightweight, self-cleaning, modular mesh. Integrated with microclimate sensors and phase-change catalysts, it scales from individual shelters to decentralized village-scale installations.

## 🗂️ Primary Category
**Atmospheric Aerial Systems → Water Yield**

---

## 🌍 Mission Purpose
To provide clean, renewable water in arid, post-disaster, or off-grid regions using a fully passive or solar-assisted system. AeroHydra™ acts as a decentralized water node in the planetary restoration network.

## 🧪 System Summary
- **Core Composition**: Metal-organic framework-coated mesh + phase-change gel layers  
- **Functionality**:
  - Harvests water from ambient air (humidity as low as 10%)  
  - Micro-adapts mesh porosity based on real-time humidity  
  - Self-cleans via solar thermal pulse  
  - Stackable units for scalable output  
- **Output Potential**: 1–5L/day per unit (passive); >10L/day with solar-assist

---

## 🌱 Origin Story
Developed in response to increasing climate-driven water scarcity, AeroHydra™ was inspired by desert beetles, fog nets, and cutting-edge atmospheric harvesting research. It forms part of the larger goal to embed water autonomy in post-collapse architecture.
