# 🎯 AI Mission Adaptation Policy

This file outlines how individual drones in the Atmospheric Filtration Drone Swarm adapt their behavior based on environmental variables, swarm feedback, battery levels, and atmospheric urgency.

---

## 📡 Policy Overview

The drone continuously evaluates internal and external conditions to adapt its current task using a rule priority table. Mission policies are ranked by urgency and filtered through environmental thresholds.

## 🎛️ Dynamic Mission Variables

- **Environment Inputs**: PM2.5/PM10, humidity, wind, GPS
- **System State**: Battery %, temperature, uptime, comms
- **Swarm Feedback**: Leader commands, group consensus
- **Weather Forecast Link**: Optional policy override

---

## 🛡️ Failsafe Interruption

At any time, mission adaptation policies yield to:
- Emergency shutdown
- Collision avoidance
- Forced landing
- Manual override

---

## 🧠 Edge Adaptation Notes

- Drones learn via reinforcement tagging of “effective” maneuvers.
- Adaptation logs are synced back to base via uplink every 6–12 hours.
