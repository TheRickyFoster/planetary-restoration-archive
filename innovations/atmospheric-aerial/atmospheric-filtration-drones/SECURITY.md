# 🛡️ Security Policy

This file defines our approach to threat prevention, incident response, and secure ecosystem participation for the Atmospheric Filtration Drone Swarm.

---

## 📦 Scope of Protection

This security policy applies to:

- DAO smart contract integrity
- Drone firmware and software codebase
- Onboard sensor logs and diagnostics
- Swarm mesh network communications
- Field operation data (e.g. GPS, pollutant data)
- GitHub repository and pipeline infrastructure

---

## ⚠️ Known Threats Considered

- Physical drone capture or sabotage
- GPS spoofing or signal jamming
- Data interception (telemetry, swarm control)
- DAO governance manipulation
- Regulatory/censorship interference
- Malware injection via external contributors

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🔐 End-to-end AES-256 encryption across DAO and drone comms
- 🔑 DAO key quorum structure: 3-of-5 multi-sig for mission logic
- 🛰️ Redundant comms via mesh, RF fallback, and Starlink burst
- ⚙️ Hash-checks on logic template diffs across swarm
- 🔁 Hardware kill-switch for physical capture scenarios
- 🧪 Code tested via CI + simulation validation per commit

## 📩 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please report it privately**:

📧 Email: [therickyfoster@gmail.com](mailto:therickyfoster@gmail.com)

All reports will be acknowledged within 24–48 hours. High-severity bugs may receive patch credit and bounty eligibility if applicable.

## 🤖 Long-Term Integrity

This system is open-source and mission-aligned — we rely on ethical contributors, white-hat researchers, and regenerative technologists to keep this swarm safe.
