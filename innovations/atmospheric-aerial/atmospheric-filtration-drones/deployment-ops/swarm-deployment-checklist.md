# ✅ Swarm Deployment Checklist

This is the official **pre-launch checklist** for deploying atmospheric filtration drones in the field. Each drone must pass this checklist before inclusion in an active swarm.

This document should be followed **before every mission**, whether it’s a test deployment or full-scale operation.

---

## 📦 Pre-Flight Drone Inspection

- [ ] Battery fully charged (or swap-ready)
- [ ] Filter module inserted and secured
- [ ] Firmware synced with current ops protocol (check hash)
- [ ] GPS + altimeter calibration complete
- [ ] IMU and prop sensors test passed
- [ ] Solar mount aligned (if present)
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance sensors verified
- [ ] Drone ID registered and matched to swarm index

---

## 🧠 Comms and DAO Sync

- [ ] Swarm coordination protocol uploaded
- [ ] DAO communication channel active
- [ ] Latency test within operational threshold (< 300ms)
- [ ] Emergency override logic test passed
- [ ] Local mission log initialized

---

## 🛰️ Region-Specific Configuration

- [ ] Deployment zone selected and confirmed
- [ ] Air quality parameters loaded for region
- [ ] Climate profile loaded (urban, coastal, etc.)
- [ ] Regulatory clearance (if required) verified
- [ ] No-fly boundaries or exclusion zones set

---

## 🛠 Emergency Readiness

- [ ] Return-to-base (RTB) logic tested
- [ ] Signal loss behavior confirmed (hover or descent)
- [ ] Manual override fallback initialized
- [ ] SOS blink/frequency pulse enabled

---

## 🔁 Operational Loop Initialization

- [ ] Filter replacement cycle timer started
- [ ] Recharge timer synced or solar override active
- [ ] Live stream telemetry confirmed to DAO
- [ ] Drone passed final auto-diagnostic
- [ ] Operator or supervisor sign-off recorded

✅ **Status:** `CLEARED FOR LAUNCH`

🛑 **If any checklist item fails, drone must be removed from the swarm queue.**
