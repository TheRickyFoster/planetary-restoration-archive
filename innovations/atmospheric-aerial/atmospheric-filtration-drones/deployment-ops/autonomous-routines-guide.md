# ⚙️ Autonomous Routines Guide – Atmospheric Filtration Drone Swarm™

This document outlines the onboard logic and adaptive flight behavior used by drones in autonomous mode. All routines have been optimized for filtration efficiency, power conservation, and real-world terrain adaptation.

## 🧠 Core Flight Patterns

### 1. **Adaptive Grid Hover**
- Drones form a soft grid that adjusts spacing based on:
  - Pollutant density (tighter in high-smog zones)
  - Neighbor drone distance (minimum buffer: 5m)
  - GPS + LIDAR terrain overlays

### 2. **Circular Drift Loops**
- Used in low-wind, open-area scenarios
- Maintains filtration over a larger radius
- Useful in coastal and forest-edge deployments

### 3. **Vertical Sweep Mode**
- Slowly ascends and descends in 5m bands
- Maximizes vertical air capture in still air conditions
- Triggered when vertical gradient of PM2.5 > 30%

## 🚨 Behavior Triggers

| Condition | Triggered Routine |
|----------|-------------------|
| Battery < 20% | Return-to-Base (RTB) |
| Filter near full | Pause and descend |
| Signal loss > 60s | Hover and pulse for pickup |
| No-fly zone entry | Immediate redirect + log |
| Nearby drone breach < 3m | Collision-avoidance thrust |

## 🌎 Terrain Logic

### Urban Grid Zones
- Narrow hover with minimal drift
- Avoid building corridors unless instructed

### Coastal/Desert Regions
- Wider grid, thermal-aware adjustments
- Solar mode toggled on during max sun

### Mountainous or Windy Zones
- Anchor-hover mode: fixed position
- Gust resistance prioritized over drift

## 🛰️ DAO Integration Behavior

- Every 60s: Upload telemetry → `DAO-swift-sync`
- Every 10m: Re-evaluate hover zone ROI
- Every 30m: Poll for override signals or re-tasking

---

##📌 All routines run inside the onboard swarm logic module. Manual override is always possible via DAO admin console.

## 🔁 Behavior Loop Pseudocode

```python
while True:
    scan_air()
    update_neighbors()
    adjust_hover_position()
    if battery < 20%:
        return_to_base()
    if filter_saturation > 95%:
        descend_and_hold()
    upload_to_dao()
    sleep(5)
