# Deployment Ops ‚Äì Atmospheric Filtration Drone Swarm‚Ñ¢

This folder contains all real-world operational tools and documents for deploying, managing, and maintaining swarms of atmospheric filtration drones in diverse environments. It bridges the gap between blueprint design and field execution.

These files are designed to ensure maximum impact, safety, and adaptability across urban, industrial, ecological, and emergency settings.

## üß≠ Purpose

- Coordinate large-scale swarm deployments
- Define autonomous drone behavior and DAO sync logic
- Prepare field crews with step-by-step guides
- Manage filter swap, battery cycles, and emergencies
- Maintain mission logs, dashboards, and regional ops data
