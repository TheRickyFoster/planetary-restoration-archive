## üîß Description

This housing reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) and protects sensitive long-range radio modules from signal degradation or electrical noise when housed near power or digital systems.

---

## Features

- Snap-on removable lid
- Internal mounting rails for RFD900 or SiK radios
- External SMA connector slot
- Integrated RF isolation compartments (for capacitor or ferrite mounting)

---

## Assembly Instructions

1. Line internal walls with copper or aluminum tape (unless using conductive filament).
2. Insert radio module using rail clips or adhesive foam.
3. Attach antenna cable via SMA passthrough.
4. Close lid and test signal strength.
