🧠 What It Is

Fog Harvester Veil Arrays™ are ultra-light, modular mesh structures that extract clean, drinkable water directly from fog and low clouds — using only wind and gravity. Inspired by the microstructures of spider webs and desert beetles, these veils are constructed from biodegradable or recycled materials, and designed for deployment in coastal deserts, mountain ranges, valleys, and rooftops.

Each array is designed to capture water droplets from fog, channel them into collection troughs, and either store them on-site or deliver them via gravity-fed piping. Veil Arrays can be scaled up rapidly in fog-heavy zones and function without pumps or electricity.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Moisture Capture

A vertical or slanted mesh veil is erected perpendicular to prevailing fog-laden winds.

Fog droplets collide with the net fibers and condense.



2. Drop Coalescence

Micro-droplets merge into larger beads via hydrophilic mesh structure or coated nanothread.



3. Gravity-Driven Collection

Collected water drips down into base gutters or funnels.



4. Storage or Flow

Water is stored in cisterns, jugs, or delivered to plant basins or piping.




🌀 Bonus: Veil Arrays can also serve as shade structures, microclimate stabilizers, or even sensor platforms for monitoring dew, pollen, or particulate matter.

🏗️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

🔧 Construction (1 Veil Unit, 2m x 4m):

1. Select Site: Ideal is high ground, open exposure to prevailing fog winds. Slopes and ridges are best.


2. Install Support Poles: Use bamboo, reclaimed metal rods, or tree stakes. Embed 0.5m deep.


3. Attach Mesh Veil: Stretch fog-harvesting mesh (e.g., Raschel mesh, recycled nylon) taut between poles.


4. Add Tension Lines: Guy wires or rope to stabilize in wind.


5. Install Collection Trough: At base of mesh, install gutter or flexible hose to collect drips.


6. Connect to Storage: Funnel into jerry cans, underground tanks, or gravity-fed irrigation pipes.



> ⏱️ Build time: ~90 minutes per veil unit (solo), <30 minutes if prefabbed
🕓 Lifespan: 2–5 years (biodegradable options available)

🔬 Scientific Basis & Studies

Fog collection is widely used in Chile, Peru, Morocco, and Ethiopia, producing thousands of liters/day.

Hydrophilic mesh materials (coated polyethylene, nylon, Raschel net) outperform untreated mesh.

Biomimicry studies show desert beetles and spider webs capture water efficiently due to fine-scale geometry.

Passive water systems outperform diesel-powered pumps in arid climates with fog bands.
