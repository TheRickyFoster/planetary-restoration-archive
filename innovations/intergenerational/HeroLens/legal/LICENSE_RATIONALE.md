## 🧠 Expert Consensus Findings

After consultation with expert groups including attorneys, copyright scholars, open-source license specialists, and AI ethics advisors, the following conclusions were reached:

1️⃣ **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 provides the strongest alignment with the project’s goals:**
- Clear prohibition of commercial reuse.
- Mandates attribution for all derivatives.
- Ensures that all adaptations remain free and open via ShareAlike.

2️⃣ **AI Use Caveat:** While no license can absolutely control use of materials for AI training under current global law, the non-commercial restriction combined with clear intent language protects the educational purpose and discourages extractive or exploitative corporate AI training.

3️⃣ **Better than MIT/GPL for this project:** Permissive software licenses like MIT/GPL allow commercial reuse by design and would conflict with the project’s principles.

4️⃣ **RAIL license was considered:** While innovative, RAIL primarily governs software models and isn’t ideally suited for the mixed nature (software + documentation + community governance templates) of this repository.
