## 1️⃣ Introduction

Welcome to **Herolens Live: The Regenerative Trust Stack** — an open-source initiative to build a radically transparent, decentralized, and regenerative platform where governance, ecological restoration, and public service converge.

Our goal is to **architect trust, incentivize good, and decentralize oversight** in a modular and globally scalable system.

---

## 2️⃣ Vision and Purpose

Herolens Live aims to:
- 🕊️ **Restore public trust** via real-time livestream transparency.
- 🌱 **Incentivize regenerative actions** with on-chain rewards.
- ⚡ **Gamify societal contributions** ("Classcraft 2.0").
- 🔒 **Preserve immutable historical records** of service and restoration efforts.
- 🌍 **Bridge centralized and decentralized systems seamlessly** for a regenerative future.

---

## 3️⃣ System Overview

Herolens is designed as a modular, extensible stack:
- 🔴 **Livestream Trust Layer**
- 🔐 **Immutable Archive Backend**
- 💸 **Incentive Engine**
- 🎮 **Gamified Behavior Framework**
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance Layer**

Each module is interoperable and built for gradual decentralization and future-proofing.

## 4️⃣ Core Modules

### 4.1️⃣ Livestream Interface
Early-stage integration with Twitch/YouTube APIs; native stack built on Livepeer + Lens Protocol for Web3-native livestreaming.

### 4.2️⃣ Immutable Archival Backend
Multi-chain notarization, IPFS pinning, redundancy across jurisdictions.

### 4.3️⃣ Incentive Engine
Crypto + fiat tipping/donations, verified "proof of impact" payouts.

### 4.4️⃣ Classcraft 2.0 Gamification
Quest system, badges, achievements, peer-reviewed reputation system.

### 4.5️⃣ DAO Governance
Multi-token architecture with voting rights, referenda, treasury management.
