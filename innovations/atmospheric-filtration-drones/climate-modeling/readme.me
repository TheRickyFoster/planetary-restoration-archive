# 🌎 Climate Modeling — Innovation #002: Atmospheric Filtration Drone Swarm™

This folder contains simulation data products, matrix analyses, and strategic modeling outputs used to evaluate the real-world impact of swarm-scale atmospheric filtration systems.

These resources help quantify the environmental return on investment (eROI) and support funding, governance, and deployment decisions for regional or planetary-scale DAO swarms.

## 🔬 About the Filtration Impact Matrix

Each cell in `filtration-impact-matrix-full.xlsx` represents the **average cost to remove 1 metric ton of airborne pollutants** for a given:

- **Filter type** (Mycelium, Zeolite, Activated Carbon, Nano-Cellulose, Hybrid)
- **Region type** (Urban Dense, Smog Belt, Industrial, Coastal, Forest Edge)

This matrix is based on **1,000 detailed DAO-modeled simulations**, run with stochastic inputs for:
- Air volume processed per day
- Pollutant concentration by region
- Drone count and operational cost
- Energy and logistics demand
