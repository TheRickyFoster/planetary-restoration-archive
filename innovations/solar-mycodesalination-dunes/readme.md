🧠 What It Is

Solar MycoDesalination Dunes™ are semi-permeable, bio-solar domes that use passive solar evaporation and fungal filtration to convert seawater into freshwater — while regenerating coastal soil microbiomes and sequestering carbon.

Each dome acts like a dune-shaped mycelial lung — absorbing seawater through capillary action, evaporating and condensing it via solar heat, and filtering toxins and salt with embedded fungi, biochar, and sand-stratified membranes.

It’s a power-free, self-repairing, and fully biodegradable solution for water-scarce coasts, deserts, and disaster zones.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Water Intake: Seawater is wicked through buried mesh tubing via natural capillary action.


2. Evaporation: Dome's upper canopy, made of translucent bioplastic, captures solar heat.


3. Condensation: Inner surface condenses clean water vapor, which drips into a central trough.


4. Fungal Filtration: Myco-layers of Aspergillus niger and Trametes versicolor neutralize salts, microplastics, and heavy metals.


5. Output: Clean water is stored in shaded containers or piped into underground cisterns.



Bonus function: As water passes through the dome’s soil base, fungal biofilms help restore coastal microbiomes and reduce erosion.

🏗️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

🔧 Construction Steps:

1. Excavate a shallow basin (~2m wide, 30cm deep).


2. Lay tubing or rope-soaked mesh from nearby seawater source (gravity-fed).


3. Create dome shell using bamboo ribs or salvaged PVC.


4. Stretch translucent bioplastic or upcycled greenhouse sheeting over the frame.


5. Add interior myco-layers: alternating beds of biochar, fungi-inoculated sand, and charcoal.


6. Position inner catch trough under condensation zone (center-low).


7. Anchor sides with rocks or stakes.


8. Test flow and airflow holes for passive pressure equalization.



> Build time: 3–6 hours per dome
Freshwater yield: 6–12 liters/day (varies by sun, humidity)
Lifespan: 1–3 years per unit, biodegradable post-use
