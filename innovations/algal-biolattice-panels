## 🧠 What It Is  

The **Algal BioLattice Panel™** is a modular, rooftop-mountable carbon capture and oxygen production panel using living microalgae (such as *Spirulina* or *Chlorella*) suspended in a self-cleaning biopolymer lattice. It functions like a living solar panel for regenerating atmosphere and food-grade biomass.

The system is designed to scale across rooftops, greenhouses, vertical walls, and mobile installations in cities or collapse-resilient zones. Each panel captures CO₂, generates oxygen, and produces nutrient-rich biomass that can be harvested or reintegrated into food/soil systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

- A **transparent outer shell** allows sunlight to energize photosynthetic algae.  
- Inside, a **biopolymer mesh lattice** holds algal cultures suspended in a nutrient solution.  
- CO₂ enters via an air intake or passive rooftop venting.  
- Algae consume CO₂ and produce O₂ via photosynthesis.  
- **Bubble ports** or aeration diffusers maintain flow and oxygenation.  
- Biomass is optionally harvested via a drain port or siphon.

## 🏗️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step)  

### 🛠️ Construction Steps:

1. Cut or shape **UV-stable transparent acrylic** or glass panel with sealed edges.  
2. Insert an inner **bio-lattice mesh** (3D-printed biopolymer or nylon scaffold).  
3. Fill with sterile solution containing Spirulina or Chlorella algae.  
4. Add small **CO₂ intake port** or open-to-air membrane.  
5. Add optional **aeration diffuser** (solar or manual pump).  
6. Seal the structure, mount on rooftop frame with solar access.

> ⏱️ Build Time: ~2–5 hours per panel  
> 🔄 Lifespan: 1–2 years per solution cycle (cleaning or reseeding recommended)
