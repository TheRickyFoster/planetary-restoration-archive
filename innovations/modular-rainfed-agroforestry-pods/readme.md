🧠 What It Is

Modular Rainfed Agroforestry Pods™ are small-scale, collapsible agricultural domes that create self-sustaining micro-ecosystems for food, fuel, medicine, and soil regeneration — all powered by rainfall, humidity, and intelligent plant-fungi pairings.

Each pod functions as a resilient agroecological unit that mimics forest dynamics while harvesting rain, nurturing symbiosis between plants and fungi, and protecting crops from climatic extremes. They’re deployable off-grid, ideal for climate refugees, post-collapse agriculture, or urban rooftops.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Rain Catchment: Dome collects rain on outer membrane, funneling it into an internal wicking soil basin.


2. Fungal Enhancement: Soil layers inoculated with mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi improve nutrient cycling.


3. Companion Guild Planting: Trees, perennials, nitrogen-fixers, and root crops arranged in natural succession.


4. Passive Ventilation: Adjustable vents regulate humidity and mimic forest edge wind behavior.


5. Soil Cooling & Moisture Retention: Biochar and mulch layers prevent evaporation and boost microbial health.


6. Modular Expansion: Units can be linked into lattices or terraces for larger regenerative food webs.

🏗️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

🔧 Construction Steps:

1. Mark a circular plot (2–3 meters wide) and level the surface.


2. Build dome structure using PVC, bamboo, or curved metal rods.


3. Drape breathable, water-channeling fabric (clear tarp or myco-treated cloth).


4. Layer internal soil system:

Bottom: Gravel + charcoal

Mid: Moisture-wicking cloth

Top: Biochar-amended compost



5. Inoculate with fungal slurry (Glomus, Trichoderma, etc).


6. Plant species in concentric rings:

Inner: fruiting trees

Mid: nitrogen-fixers, herbs

Outer: root veggies, flowers



7. Install adjustable vents or thermal mass stones.


8. Optionally connect gutter to shared cistern.



> ⏱️ Build time: 4–8 hours (team of 2)
🌧️ Water use: Rain-fed or greywater top-up
🕓 Lifespan: 3–7 years (biodegradable frame options available)

🔬 Scientific Basis & Studies

Mycorrhizal fungi shown to increase water/nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration (Smith & Read, 2008)

Agroforestry models validated to reverse desertification and improve crop stability (Leakey, 2014)

Passive rainwater harvesting reduces drought stress by 40–70% in dry climates (UN FAO, 2021)

Polyculture design proven to reduce pest load and increase ecosystem resilience (Altieri, 1995)
