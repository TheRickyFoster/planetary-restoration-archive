## 🌍 Concept Overview

Many degraded coastal, arid, and semi-arid landscapes suffer from salinity, compaction, and desiccation, preventing revegetation and ecological recovery.

**ThermoSpiral™ is a passive irrigation and soil remediation system that harnesses natural temperature gradients — such as day-night cycles and land-sea temperature differences — to drive gentle water lifting and soil hydration, enabling autonomous ecosystem restoration without pumps, fuel, or external energy.**

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Thermosiphon principle:** Daily temperature cycles generate convective flow, moving water upwards from subsurface zones to near-surface soils.  
- **Spiral underground heat exchangers:** Buried coils exploit the temperature gradient between shallow warm soils and deeper cool layers.  
- **Capillary irrigation output:** Slow, continuous hydration directly to root zones mimics natural seepage and promotes microbial and plant establishment.  
- **Modular design:** Units can irrigate small (~10–50 m²) plots and scale to landscape applications via grid deployment.

---

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** Western Australian coastal salt flats and semi-arid zones.  
**Goal:** Rehydrate and remediate 1 hectare of saline, degraded soil over two growing seasons.  
**Expected Impact:**  
- Improved soil moisture regime  
- Reduction of surface soil salinity  
- Mycelial and microbial recolonization support  
- Native vegetation establishment.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- Based on thermosiphon hydrodynamics validated in thermal engineering.  
- Zero-energy footprint — no pumps, no fuel.  
- Eco-integrated design using durable, non-toxic materials.  
- Compatible with native restoration programs and traditional land stewardship.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Select degraded area with shallow groundwater or saline moisture profile.  
2️⃣ Bury spiral tubing array at two depths (~0.3m and ~1m) to maximize temperature differential.  
3️⃣ Connect tubing outlets to capillary irrigation points distributed across site.  
4️⃣ Monitor soil moisture content and vegetation establishment seasonally.  
5️⃣ Adjust layout or module density as needed for site conditions.

---

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Validate thermosiphon efficiency in diverse soil and climate conditions.  
- Phase 2: Optimize tubing geometry and material performance for longevity.  
- Phase 3: Pilot grid-scale deployments in saline and arid zones globally.  
- Phase 4: Integrate into large-scale ecosystem restoration and climate adaptation projects.
