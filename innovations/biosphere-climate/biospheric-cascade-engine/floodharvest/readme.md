## 🌍 Concept Overview

Floods are often seen as destructive, but historically they have functioned as essential ecosystem engineers, distributing sediments, seeds, and nutrients across landscapes.

**FloodHarvest™ is a system of passive floodwater diversion structures designed to capture and redirect seasonal floodwaters into degraded inland areas, using their natural energy to transport sediments, disperse native seeds, and inoculate soils with beneficial fungi — rehydrating and restoring ecosystems at scale with minimal infrastructure or energy inputs.**

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Intelligent diversion points and channels:** Selectively breach or retrofit levees with eco-engineered gates, directing floodwaters into degraded or barren areas.  
- **Seed and mycelium banks:** Precondition target areas with native pioneer seeds and mycelial inoculants to ensure rapid ecological response when flooded.  
- **Self-regulating overflow paths:** Operate autonomously during high-flow events, diverting water only at safe flow thresholds to reduce downstream flood risk while enabling restoration.  
- **Sediment traps:** Slow flow to deposit nutrient-rich silt precisely where it’s most needed.

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** Murray-Darling Basin, Australia.  
**Goal:** Reforest and restore 200 hectares of degraded floodplain over 3–5 years.  
**Expected Impact:**  
- Accelerated vegetation recovery  
- Enhanced soil carbon and fertility  
- Re-established mycelium networks  
- Improved groundwater recharge.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- Low-footprint engineering with minimal disruption.  
- Biomimetic design inspired by historical floodplain dynamics.  
- Fully passive and scalable for small to large landscapes.  
- Can be integrated with Indigenous land management practices and natural floodplain functions.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Identify degraded inland landscapes downstream of flood-prone rivers.  
2️⃣ Map potential diversion points and historical watercourses (oxbows, depressions).  
3️⃣ Pre-seed areas with native plants and distribute mycelial inoculants.  
4️⃣ Construct simple diversion channels and eco-friendly gates to reconnect floodwaters.  
5️⃣ Monitor vegetation growth, soil carbon improvement, and groundwater recharge seasonally.

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Identify global floodplain restoration priority zones.  
- Phase 2: Pilot diversions in Australian inland catchments.  
- Phase 3: Measure ecological co-benefits (biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water storage).  
- Phase 4: Develop modular blueprints for varied regional hydrologies.
