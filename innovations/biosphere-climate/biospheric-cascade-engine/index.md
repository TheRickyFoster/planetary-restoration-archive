# 🌿 Natural Force Blueprint Series

Welcome to the **Natural Force Blueprint Series** — a growing collection of deployable, open-source designs for leveraging Earth’s colossal natural forces (rivers, tides, waves, floods, temperature gradients) to accelerate biosphere restoration and planetary healing.

Every blueprint is:
- **Fully self-contained**
- **Biomimetic**
- **Open-source and non-commercial**
- **Designed for community, NGO, and Indigenous stewardship**
