## 🌍 Concept Overview

Many degraded marine ecosystems — coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove belts — lack natural seed and propagule dispersal vectors due to ecosystem fragmentation and human impacts.

**CurrentCourier™ is a passive, biomimetic restoration system that uses biodegradable, buoyancy-controlled ecological seed pods designed to ride predictable ocean currents, delivering coral larvae, seagrass seeds, mangrove propagules, or mycelial inoculants to degraded sites at landscape scale — all without fuel, infrastructure, or active human intervention.**

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Biodegradable seed pods:** Constructed from natural materials such as mycelium composites, coconut coir, or starch-based bioplastics.  
- **Tunable buoyancy:** Ensures proper travel depth within the water column for ecological delivery.  
- **Time-release/self-planting design:** Pods degrade or open based on salinity, temperature, or residence time to release viable material at target sites.  
- **Currents as free transport:** Released upstream or upcurrent of restoration zones to maximize passive delivery efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** Great Barrier Reef and adjacent Queensland mangrove coastlines.  
**Goal:** Distribute millions of native mangrove propagules and coral larvae along 500+ km of coastline after storm and bleaching events.  
**Expected Impact:**  
- Enhanced natural recruitment of mangroves and corals  
- Rapid rewilding of degraded habitats  
- Low-cost, scalable solution requiring minimal logistics.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- 100% biodegradable materials eliminate pollution risk.  
- Mimics natural dispersal processes (oceanic drift, flood dispersal).  
- No active infrastructure required at recipient sites.  
- Deployable by communities, NGOs, Indigenous stewards, or restoration fleets.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Identify degraded marine/coastal zones and map current patterns.  
2️⃣ Select native seeds, propagules, or larvae species appropriate for target habitat.  
3️⃣ Fabricate biodegradable seed pods with optimized buoyancy profile.  
4️⃣ Release pods at identified upcurrent positions.  
5️⃣ Monitor recruitment and ecological colonization over following seasons.

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Biodegradable pod material optimization and degradation timing studies.  
- Phase 2: Pilot deployments at representative sites (reef, seagrass, mangrove).  
- Phase 3: GPS/biodegradable tagging for dispersal tracking.  
- Phase 4: Develop regional pod designs tuned to local currents and ecosystems.
