## 🌍 Concept Overview

Mangrove forests provide critical coastal protection, habitat, and blue carbon sequestration but are declining globally due to interrupted tidal flows and degraded soils.  
Modern infrastructure often blocks or reduces the natural rise and fall of tides, impairing mangrove regeneration.

**Tidal Pulse™ is a passive, autonomous system that restores natural hydrological cycles by using self-regulating tidal gates and channels to enable irrigation, soil flushing, and oxygenation in degraded mangrove zones — powered entirely by predictable tidal energy.**

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Self-regulating tidal gates and channels:** One-way tidal valves and eco-engineered breaches allow seawater inflow at high tide and gentle drainage at ebb.
- **Soil revitalization:** Tidal flow flushes excess salts, oxygenates root zones, and delivers essential nutrients to support seedling survival.
- **Restores hydrological connectivity:** Retrofits to blocked wetlands to reconnect them to tidal cycles, rebuilding coastal resilience.

---

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** Degraded mangrove zones, Queensland, Australia.  
**Goal:** Restore hydrological function and natural regeneration on 100 hectares over 3 years.  
**Expected Impact:** 
- Accelerated natural colonization by mangrove seedlings  
- Enhanced fish nursery habitats  
- Boost in biodiversity and long-term blue carbon storage.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- Minimal engineering footprint and low maintenance.  
- Fully biodegradable or sustainably sourced materials for tidal structures where feasible.  
- Channels shaped to mimic natural estuarine conditions for maximum ecological acceptance.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Map historical mangrove extent and identify barriers to tidal flow.  
2️⃣ Select optimal sites for culvert installation or eco-breach construction.  
3️⃣ Install one-way tidal valves and reconnect natural channels.  
4️⃣ Monitor salinity, seedling emergence, and soil condition quarterly.  
5️⃣ Adapt and expand system as restoration progresses.

---

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Validate tidal valve design in varying estuarine geomorphologies.  
- Phase 2: Pilot deployment in Australian mangrove restoration areas.  
- Phase 3: Develop standardized templates for use globally.  
- Phase 4: Integrate with native seedling planting programs and long-term monitoring networks.
