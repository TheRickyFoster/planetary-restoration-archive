## 🌍 Concept Overview

Coastal dead zones — regions of hypoxic (low oxygen) water — are increasing globally due to nutrient pollution, warming oceans, and altered currents, severely degrading marine ecosystems.

**WaveForge™ is a passive, mechanical system that directly converts wave kinetic energy into vertical water mixing and aeration — restoring oxygen levels, eliminating stratification, and enabling ecosystem recovery without any external energy input, fuel, or electronics.**

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Oscillating buoy-piston mechanism:** A floating buoy connected to a vertical piston harnesses wave action to drive up-and-down pumping.  
- **Vertical mixing:** Draws deep, oxygen-poor water upwards while inducing turbulence at the surface to enhance air-water oxygen exchange.  
- **Modular and scalable:** Each unit serves ~1–5 hectares; arrays can cover large coastal dead zones.

---

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Australia.  
**Goal:** Aerate 50 hectares of hypoxic coastal water over 6 months.  
**Expected Impact:**  
- Oxygen concentration increases from <2 mg/L to >4 mg/L  
- Recovery of fish populations and benthic biodiversity  
- Reduction of harmful algal blooms.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- 100% passive system driven by ambient wave energy.  
- No moving parts requiring external power or electronics.  
- Suitable for shallow coastal areas and estuaries.  
- Storm-resilient and low-maintenance.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Survey site for wave characteristics and hypoxia extent.  
2️⃣ Determine deployment density (~1–5 hectares per unit).  
3️⃣ Fabricate buoy-piston assemblies using marine-grade and/or biodegradable materials.  
4️⃣ Deploy moored units in array pattern at target location.  
5️⃣ Monitor oxygen levels and water quality monthly.

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Field validation of mechanical mixing performance.  
- Phase 2: Optimize buoy geometry and piston stroke length for varied wave climates.  
- Phase 3: Develop regional designs tailored for different ecosystems.  
- Phase 4: Integrate with coastal restoration programs globally.
