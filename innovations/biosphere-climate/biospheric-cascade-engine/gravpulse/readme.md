## 🌍 Concept Overview

Coastal and estuarine zones globally are suffering from nutrient overload (eutrophication), agricultural runoff, and industrial pollutants that degrade water quality and damage ecosystems.

**GravPulse™ is a passive, autonomous water treatment system that leverages gravitational tidal cycles to move polluted water through biochar-enhanced wetland basins — removing excess nutrients, heavy metals, and contaminants while simultaneously restoring wetland habitat and sequestering carbon.**

---

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation: How It Works

- **Tidal cycle-driven flow:** Rising tides push nutrient-rich water into elevated wetland basins; falling tides gently drain treated water back to the estuary.  
- **Biochar filtration:** Biochar provides exceptional surface area and adsorption capacity, capturing nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals, and organic pollutants while supporting beneficial microbial communities.  
- **Retrofit degraded wetlands:** GravPulse™ systems can rehabilitate abandoned saltmarshes, disconnected estuarine floodplains, or constructed wetlands.

---

## 🎯 Example Deployment

**Location:** NSW estuaries downstream of agricultural catchments.  
**Goal:** Treat and restore degraded estuarine water quality over 100 hectares using natural tidal cycles and biochar wetlands.  
**Expected Impact:**  
- 30–70% nutrient reduction (N, P)  
- Heavy metal adsorption depending on inflow concentrations  
- Restoration of wetland biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## 🔬 Science-backed Design

- Fully passive, self-powered by predictable gravitational tides.  
- Carbon-negative: biochar itself is a carbon sink while also enabling water quality improvement.  
- Materials selected for durability, low ecological footprint, and ecological harmonization.  
- Compatible with nature-based solutions frameworks and ecosystem-based management.

## 🏗️ DIY / Deployment Guide

1️⃣ Identify degraded wetland or estuarine basin near tidal flow.  
2️⃣ Prepare biochar-enhanced filter beds integrated into the wetland soil profile.  
3️⃣ Engineer flow paths so tidal rise and fall move polluted water through these beds.  
4️⃣ Monitor water quality pre- and post-treatment seasonally.  
5️⃣ Adapt structure designs for sediment load, tidal range, and target pollutants.

---

## 📡 Research Roadmap

- Phase 1: Validate biochar material performance for various pollutants in coastal environments.  
- Phase 2: Prototype GravPulse™ at representative pilot sites.  
- Phase 3: Develop region-specific flow and filtration designs.  
- Phase 4: Scale globally as modular ecological infrastructure for water quality restoration.
