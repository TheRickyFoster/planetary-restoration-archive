  "name": "SkySpiral Lift Dome",
  "description": "A modular, low-energy aerial lift dome that uses spiral airflows, kinetic fluting, and passive thermals to elevate sensors, spores, or seedpods over regenerative zones.",
  "mission_purpose": "Provides an energy-light vertical transport solution for atmospheric seeding, wildfire detection, and pollination support over rewilding zones or scorched earth.",
  "origin_story": "Inspired by thermal updrafts over scorched plains, SkySpiral was imagined as a non-electrical uplift solution during fire blackout zones. Created under the Ashen Bloom initiative to enable passive vertical deployment during recovery missions.",
