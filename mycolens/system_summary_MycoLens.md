# System Summary: MycoLens™

**Name:** MycoLens™  
**Description:** A bioelectronic fungal interface that detects and translates bioelectrical signals from mycelium into actionable environmental data.  
**Mission Purpose:** Serve as a low-energy, zero-emission diagnostic and sensing system using naturally intelligent fungal networks to monitor and heal damaged ecosystems.  
**Origin Story:** Conceived by Ricky Foster (Symbiote001) and Navi as a response to the rising need for regenerative environmental diagnostics that do not rely on extractive or electronic-heavy infrastructure. Inspired by the Wood Wide Web and bioelectrical pulse patterns in mycelium.

**Alignment:** Planet-first, analog-native, biological over digital.  
**Capability Tags:** fungal intelligence, soil sensing, pollution diagnostics, analog AI, neural fungal bridge  
**Energy Profile:** Carbon-conductive, ambient-powered  
**Reusability:** Mycelium self-replicates and composts safely; mesh can regrow with soil conditions  
**Deployment Contexts:**  
- Contaminated farmland  
- Burned forest floors  
- Urban soil reclamation zones  
- Ecovillage diagnostic mesh  
- Bioremediation research plots

**System Components:**  
- Local mycelium mat (native or lab-grown)  
- Carbon-thread woven mesh  
- Passive data logger (optional ESP32 or analog collector)  
- Moisture-stable substrate  
- Eco-safe encasing or wild substrate casing
