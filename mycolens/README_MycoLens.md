# MycoLens™: Fungal Intelligence Interface

## 🍄 Innovation Summary
**MycoLens™** is a decentralized, living bio-sensor system that uses fungal mycelium networks to detect, interpret, and respond to environmental stimuli. It serves as a non-invasive data-gathering mesh with bioelectrical pattern recognition and potential neural interfacing.

## 🗂️ Primary Category
**Bioelectronic Systems → Decentralized Sensing Networks**

---

## 🌍 Mission Purpose
To create low-energy, living networks that act as distributed biosensors for ecosystem health, pollution detection, soil vitality, and post-disaster bioremediation signaling.

---

## 🧪 System Summary
- **Core Composition**: Native mycelial substrates + embedded carbon-thread electrodes  
- **Functionality**:
  - Detects soil chemistry, water activity, toxins, and temperature shifts  
  - Interprets bioelectric pulses into digital signals  
  - Enables forest or field-scale sensing with minimal infrastructure  
  - Possible AI-linguistic fungal translation using neural embeddings

---

## 🌱 Origin Story
Inspired by the Wood Wide Web and recent research on fungal communication, MycoLens™ was developed to bring quiet biological intelligence into planetary repair loops. It uses no Wi-Fi or emissions — only biology and carbon.
